# anytime_cpp

Anytime algorithms implemented in C++


## Development

This is a [CMake] project. Best IDE to use is [CLion]. You can open this directory in CLion, and it should automatically
detect it as a CMake project. Then you can use it to build / run / debug specific targets.

You can also build and run everything from terminal (using `cmake` CLI).

The dependencies (external libraries) can be installed by running the following commands in the project root:
```bash
./dependencies_download.sh
./dependencies_build.sh
```
